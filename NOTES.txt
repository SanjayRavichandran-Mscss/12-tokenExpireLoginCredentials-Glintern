TASK - 12 : Student Registration and Login System with Token Expiry Notification

This project is a Node.js application using MySQL for a student registration and login system. 
It has two main endpoints:

Student Registration: Students can register by providing their roll number, name, email, and password.
The password is hashed using bcrypt for security.
A confirmation email is sent upon successful registration.

Student Login: Students log in using their roll number, email, and password. Upon successful login, a JSON Web Token (JWT) is issued with a 3-minute expiry. 
A login confirmation email is sent.
When the token expires, an automated email notifies the user, and a message appears in the console. 
The project uses a MySQL connection pool, Nodemailer for email functionality, and node-schedule for scheduling the token expiry notifications.
Configuration values are stored in a .env file for security.
